How can you have run-tests for a program that accepts standard input?
The answer is to use a bash `here document'. For example:

$ java ProgramName << EOI
put your
standard input here
on as many
lines as you need
as though you
are typing it
into the program.
EOI

The word `EOI' can be any word you choose: you specify it after the << and
then use it to mark the end of the input. You must have no leading or trailing
spaces on the line that ends the input.

For example:

$ java ShapeShift << END
1
0 0
1
2 2
END
