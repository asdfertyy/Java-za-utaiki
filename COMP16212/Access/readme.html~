The Jaccesshelper tool is installed locally. To use jaccesshelper,  simply type:

<CENTER>
<CODE>jahelper</CODE>
</CENTER>
From  `Java Accessiblity Helper', select `New Test Set' from the
File menu.
<P>
On `Test Set Properties' you will need to edit the Class Path and add
the Application Class. To run class <CODE>SDBGUI</CODE>, enter
<CODE>SDBGUI</CODE> as the Application Class, then give its location
by editing the Class Path and inserting the path to
<CODE>SDBGUI</CODE>. You will also need to add any other components of
the Class Path which you use, for example for
<CODE>MP3Player.jar</CODE>.
<P>
You should now be able to start generating tests.
