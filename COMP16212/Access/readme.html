The `jaccesshelper' tool is installed locally. 
<P>
To use jaccesshelper,  simply type:
<CODE>jahelper</CODE>
<P>
From the  `Java Accessiblity Helper' window, select `New Test Set' from the
File menu.
<P>
On `Test Set Properties' you will need to edit the Class Path and add
the Application Class. To run class <CODE>SDBGUI</CODE>, enter
<CODE>SDBGUI</CODE> as the Application Class, then give its location
by editing the Class Path and inserting the path to
<CODE>SDBGUI</CODE>. You will also need to add any other components of
the Class Path which you use, for example for
<CODE>MP3Player.jar</CODE>.
<P>
You should now be able to start generating tests. You should see your
application start up and then the various accessibility tools will be
invoked to produce a report.
<P>
